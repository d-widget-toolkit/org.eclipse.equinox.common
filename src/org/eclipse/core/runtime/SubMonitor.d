/**
 * <p>A progress monitor that uses a given amount of work ticks from a parent monitor. This is intended as a
 * safer, easier-to-use alternative to SubProgressMonitor. The main benefits of SubMonitor over
 * SubProgressMonitor are:</p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>It is not necessary to call beginTask() or done() on an instance of SubMonitor.</li>
 * <li>SubMonitor has a simpler syntax for creating nested monitors.</li>
 * <li>SubMonitor is more efficient for deep recursion chains.</li>
 * <li>SubMonitor has a setWorkRemining method that allows the remaining space on the monitor to be
 * redistributed without reporting any work.</li>
 * <li>SubMonitor protects the caller from common progress reporting bugs in a called method. For example,
 * if a called method fails to call done() on the given monitor or fails to consume all the ticks on
 * the given monitor, the parent will correct the problem after the method returns.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p></p>
 * <p><b>USAGE:</b></p>
 *
 * <p>When implementing a method that accepts an IProgressMonitor:</p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>At the start of your method, use <code>SubMonitor.convert(...).</code> to convert the IProgressMonitor
 * into a SubMonitor. </li>
 * <li>Use <code>SubMonitor.newChild(...)</code> whenever you need to call another method that
 * accepts an IProgressMonitor.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p></p>
 * <p><b>DEFAULT BEHAVIOR:</b></p>
 *
 * <p>When writing JavaDoc for a method that accepts an IProgressMonitor, you should assume the
 * following default behavior unless the method's JavaDoc says otherwise:</p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>It WILL call beginTask on the IProgressMonitor.</li>
 * <li>It WILL NOT accept a null argument.</li>
 * <li>It WILL call done on the IProgressMonitor.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p></p>
 * <p><b>BEST PRACTISES:</b></p>
 *
 * <p>We recommend that newly-written methods follow the given contract:</p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>It WILL call beginTask on the IProgressMonitor.</li>
 * <li>It WILL accept a null argument, indicating that no progress should be reported and the operation cannot be cancelled.</li>
 * <li>It WILL NOT call done on the IProgressMonitor, leaving this responsibility up to the caller.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>If you wish to follow these conventions, you may copy and paste the following text into your method's JavaDoc:</p>
 *
 * <pre>@param monitor the progress monitor to use for reporting progress to the user. It is the caller's responsibility
 *        to call done() on the given monitor. Accepts <code>null</code>, indicating that no progress should be
 *        reported and that the operation cannot be cancelled.</pre>
 *
 * <p></p>
 * <p><b>Example: Recommended usage</b></p>
 *
 * <p>This example demonstrates how the recommended usage of <code>SubMonitor</code> makes it unnecessary to call
 * IProgressMonitor.done() in most situations.</p>
 *
 * <p>It is never necessary to call done() on a monitor obtained from <code>convert</code> or <code>progress.newChild()</code>.
 * In this example, there is no guarantee that <code>monitor</code> is an instance of <code>SubMonitor</code>, making it
 * necessary to call <code>monitor.done()</code>. The JavaDoc contract makes this the responsibility of the caller.</p>
 *
 * <pre>
 *      // param monitor the progress monitor to use for reporting progress to the user. It is the caller's responsibility
 *      //        to call done() on the given monitor. Accepts <code>null</code>, indicating that no progress should be
 *      //        reported and that the operation cannot be cancelled.
 *      //
 *      void doSomething(IProgressMonitor monitor) {
 *          // Convert the given monitor into a progress instance
 *          SubMonitor progress = SubMonitor.convert(monitor, 100);
 *
 *          // Use 30% of the progress to do some work
 *          doSomeWork(progress.newChild(30));
 *
 *          // Advance the monitor by another 30%
 *          progress.worked(30);
 *
 *          // Use the remaining 40% of the progress to do some more work
 *          doSomeWork(progress.newChild(40));
 *      }
 * </pre>
 *
 *
 * <p></p>
 * <p><b>Example: Default usage</b></p>
 *
 * <p>You will often need to implement a method that does not explicitly stipulate that calling done() is the responsibility
 * of the caller. In this case, you should use the following pattern:</p>
 *
 * <pre>
 *      // param monitor the progress monitor to use for reporting progress to the user, or <code>null</code> indicating
 *      //        that no progress should be reported and the operation cannot be cancelled.
 *      //
 *      void doSomething(IProgressMonitor monitor) {
 *          // Convert the given monitor into a progress instance
 *          SubMonitor progress = SubMonitor.convert(monitor, 100);
 *          try {
 *              // Use 30% of the progress to do some work
 *              doSomeWork(progress.newChild(30));
 *
 *              // Advance the monitor by another 30%
 *              progress.worked(30);
 *
 *              // Use the remaining 40% of the progress to do some more work
 *              doSomeWork(progress.newChild(40));
 *
 *          } finally {
 *              if (monitor !is null) {
 *                  monitor.done();
 *              }
 *          }
 *      }
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p></p>
 * <p><b>Example: Branches</b></p>
 *
 * <p>This example demonstrates how to smoothly report progress in situations where some of the work is optional.</p>
 *
 * <pre>
 *      void doSomething(IProgressMonitor monitor) {
 *          SubMonitor progress = SubMonitor.convert(monitor, 100);
 *
 *          if (condition) {
 *              // Use 50% of the progress to do some work
 *              doSomeWork(progress.newChild(50));
 *          }
 *
 *          // Don't report any work, but ensure that we have 50 ticks remaining on the progress monitor.
 *          // If we already consumed 50 ticks in the above branch, this is a no-op. Otherwise, the remaining
 *          // space in the monitor is redistributed into 50 ticks.
 *
 *          progress.setWorkRemaining(50);
 *
 *          // Use the remainder of the progress monitor to do the rest of the work
 *          doSomeWork(progress.newChild(50));
 *      }
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>Please beware of the following anti-pattern:</p>
 *
 * <pre>
 *          if (condition) {
 *              // Use 50% of the progress to do some work
 *              doSomeWork(progress.newChild(50));
 *          } else {
 *              // Bad: Causes the progress monitor to appear to start at 50%, wasting half of the
 *              // space in the monitor.
 *              progress.worked(50);
 *          }
 * </pre>
 *
 *
 * <p></p>
 * <p><b>Example: Loops</b></p>
 *
 * <p>This example demonstrates how to report progress in a loop.</p>
 *
 * <pre>
 *      void doSomething(IProgressMonitor monitor, Collection someCollection) {
 *          SubMonitor progress = SubMonitor.convert(monitor, 100);
 *
 *          // Create a new progress monitor that uses 70% of the total progress and will allocate one tick
 *          // for each element of the given collection.
 *          SubMonitor loopProgress = progress.newChild(70).setWorkRemaining(someCollection.size());
 *
 *          for (Iterator iter = someCollection.iterator(); iter.hasNext();) {
 *              Object next = iter.next();
 *
 *              doWorkOnElement(next, loopProgress.newChild(1));
 *          }
 *
 *          // Use the remaining 30% of the progress monitor to do some work outside the loop
 *          doSomeWork(progress.newChild(30));
 *      }
 * </pre>
 *
 *
 * <p></p>
 * <p><b>Example: Infinite progress</b></p>
 *
 * <p>This example demonstrates how to report logarithmic progress in situations where the number of ticks
 * cannot be easily computed in advance.</p>
 *
 * <pre>
 *      void doSomething(IProgressMonitor monitor, LinkedListNode node) {
 *          SubMonitor progress = SubMonitor.convert(monitor);
 *
 *          while (node !is null) {
 *              // Regardless of the amount of progress reported so far,
 *              // use 0.01% of the space remaining in the monitor to process the next node.
 *              progress.setWorkRemaining(10000);
 *
 *              doWorkOnElement(node, progress.newChild(1));
 *
 *              node = node.next;
 *          }
 *      }
 * </pre>
